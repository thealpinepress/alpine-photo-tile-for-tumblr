# About

*We at the Alpine Press strive to create plugins that are stylish, well-programmed, highly customizable, and intuitive to use.  These may seem like  simple objectives, but theyâ€™re surprisingly complicated to achieve in unison.  We understand that you use WordPress to create a unique online experience for yourself and your visitors. As a result, many of our plugin features may be turned on and off at your discretion, making our products truly yours.  We hope you like our work and find our website helpful and engaging.*

**The Alpine Press plugins have been originally developed by Eric Burger & Kylin Navarro.**

In 2016 all the plugins and the rights were passed over to Paul Petershagen and he published the plugins on GitHub to allow a wider contribution from the community.
